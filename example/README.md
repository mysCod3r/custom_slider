# custom_slider_example
A Flutter package for voting for apps or adjusting the difficulty for game style apps.

## Usage
If your .svg file is in assets/svg/ location you just need to enter the name of the file, if it is in a different location you have to give the full path.

```dart
     CustomSlider(
              borderNameOrPath: "rectangle",
              maxValue: 4,
              minValue: 0,
              onChanged: (p0) {}
              nameOrPath: "assets/svg/hwa.svg",
              width: 48,
            ),

```
